[CKB](https://ckbhome.jax.org) - **C**linical **K**nowledge**b**ase - is a cancer knowledgebase provided by Jackson Lab. 
 
 This module imports the data that is provided in json format (CKB FLEX), and in addition does the following:
  *  For each molecular profile, determines the event type as defined by the [SERVE](../serve/README.md) datamodel.
  *  Provides classification mapping to map all molecular profiles onto [SERVE](../serve/README.md) actionable events.
  *  Loads up the database into a MySQL database
